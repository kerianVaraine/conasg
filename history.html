                    <p>In 1972 David and Kathryn Sinclair started in the world of agriculture contractors offering a full silage service, in the main Southland district of Opio, working out the farmily farm.</p>
                    <p>After a few years, they decided it was time to expand and accomodate their growing client base</p>
                    <p>In 1989 Conasg Contracting and Engineering Ltd was established when the family moved to the farming district of Dipton, where the company has been for the last 29 years.</p>
                    <p>The 89 acres they purchased was an established deer farm, which continued to be the other source of income when the silage was finished for the season. On the property was a deer/shearing shed and workshop for repairs and maintenace of the farm and contracting machinery.</p>
                    <p>in 200 the deer were all but sold and contracting and engineering became the main focus.</p>
                    <p>In the following years silage was the main source of income. The first two choppers were FC80 side mounted, followed by FCT850, FCT900 and two 1100's - both had grass front cuts. One was converted to a direct front cut for crop.</p>
                    <p>With the purchase of the New Holland FX28 self propelled chopper with a grass front cut and a direct cut attachment for whole crop.</p>
                    <p>The other gear in the fleet consisted of an Hitachi FX28 12 tonne digger used to roll the stack and was operated by the youngest son.</p>
                    <p>3 6x4 tipper trucks to cart the grass.</p>
                    <p>New Holland tractors are used on the double mowers and rake. along with a new implement shed in 2010.</p>
                    <p>In the years that followed, Conasg Contracting & Engineering has grown to what it is today.</p>
